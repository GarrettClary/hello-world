"...time-honored tradition in computer programming."

College student who's ability to program is slowly catching up with his interest in programming.

Using this repository as a pseudo blog (not completely sold on that idea) and to practice Git from the command line.

I like to do things the right way and continually strive to implement all applicable standards and conventions.
I am always receptive to constructive criticism and never fall into the trap of thinking that I know all there is
to know about a particular subject. Hopefully I can contribute to projects I use or find interesting, even doing
documentation for projects seems like a great way to get started.

I am nowhere near the best or most efficient with these programs or tools but they are my preference (not only
computer related) and in the spirit of my Git testing, pseudo-blog, repo here we go:

Linux (CLI in general)
Vim
Bash
Radare2
Pure espresso (I'll settle for just black coffee)
Manual transmissions
