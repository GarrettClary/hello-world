"...time-honored tradition in computer programming."

College student who's ability to program is slowly catching up with his interest in programming.

Using this repository as a pseudo blog for the time being.

I try to learn the right way of doing things and always strive to know and implement best practices.
I am always receptive to constructive criticism and never fall into the trap of thinking that I know more than I do
(hopefully). I look forward to contributing to projects if possible, and am excited to get involved more with
open-source projects.

I am nowhere near the best, most efficient, or knowledgeable with the following however in the spirit of my Git
testing, pseudo-blog repo, here are my preferences.

-Linux (CLI in general)
-Vim
-Bash
-Radare2
-Straight Espresso
-Standard Transmissions
-Hard truth
